# Best Friend Gift Website

A minimalist, darkâ€‘themed website built as a heartfelt gift to celebrate
friendship.  Inspired by the original anniversary site, this project
presents a few simple pages that highlight shared memories through
videos and photos.  The design leans toward an emo/rock aesthetic with
subtle skeletonâ€‘inspired accents while avoiding anything offensive or
satanic.  All content is responsive and should look great on both
desktop and mobile screens.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Landing page** â€“ A warm welcome with a catchy title and short
  description.  Dark, moody styling sets the tone and a single
  *Start the Journey* button invites your friend to explore.
- **Explanation page** â€“ Briefly explains the purpose of the site
  and includes a simple *video selector*.  Use the left/right
  skeletonâ€‘style arrows to switch between videos.  Each slide shows
  the personâ€™s name and a playable video.
- **Video carousel** â€“ A 3Dâ€‘style carousel (adapted from the
  anniversary site) that presents one video at a time.  Smooth
  transitions move items between centre, left and right positions.
  The caption below each video displays the friendâ€™s name.  Left and
  right skeleton arrows allow manual navigation.  Videos autoâ€‘pause
  when switching slides.
- **Picture compilation** â€“ A responsive grid of photos representing
  shared memories.  Feel free to add as many pictures as you like
  here.  A button at the bottom lets you start over.

        memory1.jpg, memory2.pngâ€¦)
```

## ðŸ“‚ Placing Your Files

- **Videos**: Put your friendship videos into the
  `assets/videos/` directory.  Update the arrays in
  `js/videoSelector.js` and `carousel.html` so that each entry
  references the correct file name and includes the personâ€™s name.
- **Pictures**: Put your photos into `assets/images/` and update
  `final.html` by duplicating the `<div class="grid-item"><imgâ€¦></div>`
  blocks for each photo.  Replace the `src` attribute with your own
  filenames.

The project ships with empty `videos` and `images` folders to give
you a place to drop your own assets.  Feel free to create
subdirectories inside those folders if needed.

## ðŸ›  Running Locally

No special tooling is requiredâ€”everything is plain HTML, CSS and
JavaScript.  To run the project locally:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place your video and image files into the `assets` folders as
   described above.
3. Open `src/index.html` in your favourite web browser.  Because
   everything is selfâ€‘contained, you can simply doubleâ€‘click the file
   or serve it via a lightweight server if you prefer.

For deployment on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc. you can serve
the `src` directory as static content.  Make sure that the `assets`
directory is deployed alongside `src` so that your videos and images
are accessible.

## ðŸŽ¨ Customisation

The dark styling uses CSS variables and gradients so you can easily
tweak colours in `css/style.css`.  Look for the variables at the top
of the file (e.g. `--background-dark`, `--accent-colour`) and adjust
them to suit your taste.  Skeletonâ€‘themed buttons are implemented
purely in CSS via borders and subtle shading; if you wish to use
external icons or fonts, simply replace the content inside the
buttons.

Enjoy making this gift uniquely yours!
